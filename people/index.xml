problems at the interface of collective behavior and movement ecology.
He applies a wide range of techniques (theoretical modeling, numerical
simulations, lab experiments and field-work) to explore topics including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>collective search,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>sensing and navigation,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the role of collective decision making (both spatial and temporal) in animal migration,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the implications of group-level behaviors on ecological and evolutionary processes,&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the joint evolution of dispersal and local adaptation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Andrew did his postdoc at the Santa Fe Institute and then wrote some
papers about collective behavior that all his grad students think are the
coolest, so here we are working in his lab.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/annepolyakov/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/annepolyakov/</guid><description>&lt;p>Anne Polyakov is a PhD candidate within the Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management Program at the University of Washington, an interdisciplinary program focused on the application of advanced statistical tools to address complex ecological systems. Anne&amp;rsquo;s research involves using statistical analysis and ecological modeling to understand ecological processes, with an emphasis on biodiversity conservation and the role of microbial functions in forest carbon and nitrogen cycling. Anne&amp;rsquo;s current projects include using machine learning to predict forest carbon allocation belowground to fungal symbionts and statistical modeling to map the flow of salmon-derived nutrients through fungal systems. Anne is especially interested in using state of the art modeling approaches to understand fungal processes and contribute to research on fungal biodiversity and conservation. Some of Anne’s other work includes quantifying collective behavior in Pacific salmon, modeling population dynamics of small mammals, and examining biodiversity conservation in the agricultural matrix. Anne’s doctoral research centers on quantifying fungal processes such as fungal-plant trading dynamics through mycorrhizal fungal networks, using a combination of field work, genomics, stable isotope biogeochemistry, and modeling.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/benkoger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/benkoger/</guid><description>&lt;p>Ben works on creating systems that allow for the easy and automated study of
large animal groups in the wild. In fact, the tagline of his website is
&amp;ldquo;&lt;em>Creating drone and deep learning based systems for studying animal groups in
the wild.&lt;/em>&amp;rdquo; He went up to Alaska with Andrew this summer and filmed a ton of
footage of salmon in rivers and streams in 4K and now plans to use the
absolutely massive computer in his office to work on computer vision about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/mariakuruvilla/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/mariakuruvilla/</guid><description>&lt;p>Maria studies how environmental and social factors affect how fish move.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In her first project she studied how temperature affects the ability of a school of fish to respond to a predator. She used lab experiments, videos of fish swimming, and computer vision software to track the fish. She found that how temperature affects their swimming speed and acceleration depends on whether they are trying to escape from a predator or not.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/connieokasaki/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/connieokasaki/</guid><description>&lt;p>Connie&amp;rsquo;s general research interests include bridging the gaps between
mechanistic modeling, spatial statistics, and constrained optimization.
She is particularly&amp;hellip; and then that&amp;rsquo;s where her website cuts off.
(Connie if you see this, I think your github.io page is down.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Connie is a board game player extraordinaire. She has a backpack that can hold
upwards of 30 games in organized little pockets or drawers. She also plays Bells
for a bell choir called Bells of the Sound and here&amp;rsquo;s her bio from their website:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/hungminhsu/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/hungminhsu/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hung-Min Hsu is now a senior research scientist at &lt;a href="https://www.aiwaysion.com/our-team">AIWaysion Inc&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/arialbrewer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/arialbrewer/</guid><description>&lt;p>Arial is broadly interested in the ecology, behavior, communication, and sociality
of marine mammals. For her PhD, she is investigating the vocal behavior, intra-population
genetic structure, and epidermal microbial patterns of the endangered Cook Inlet
beluga whale population. She is also a marine mammal biologist at NOAA and studies
the acoustic ecology of cetaceans in the North Pacific. Arial enjoys being in the
field and has been involved in marine mammal surveys off the coasts of Mexico,
California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Alaska and Hawaii. Prior to moving
to Seattle from California, Arial worked as a marine mammal trainer and research
technician studying the bio-acoustics and behavior of bottlenose dolphins, killer whales,
walrus, sea lions, seals, and sea otters. Arial earned her Bachelor of Science degree
in Marine Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2010, and is
excited to be back in academia to help further the conservation effort of endangered
cetacean species. Arial enjoys sailing, scuba diving, camping, wildlife photography,
and hiking with her pup.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/brendanwallace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/brendanwallace/</guid><description>&lt;p>Brendan is interested in complex systems, network science, and general patterns
in movement of people and animals. His background is in applied math and computer science. Before
UW, he worked on modeling traffic for Google maps. He&amp;rsquo;s currently working on
introducing risk-structure and movement frequency to an epidemiological model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brendan loves board games, ultimate frisbee, talking about why cars are the
worst, and talking about why Golang is the best and everyone should learn it.
He has a very cute dog that everyone loves and has been to the office exactly
one time (but maybe she&amp;rsquo;ll be back!). He&amp;rsquo;s already been a TA 9 times which has
to be some kind of record.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

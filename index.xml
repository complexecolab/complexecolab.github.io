He applies a wide range of techniques (theoretical modeling, numerical simulations, lab experiments and field-work) to explore topics including:
collective search, sensing and navigation, the role of collective decision making (both spatial and temporal) in animal migration, the implications of group-level behaviors on ecological and evolutionary processes, the joint evolution of dispersal and local adaptation Andrew did his postdoc at the Santa Fe Institute and then wrote some papers about collective behavior that all his grad students think are the coolest, so here we are working in his lab.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/benkoger/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/benkoger/</guid><description>Ben works on creating systems that allow for the easy and automated study of large animal groups in the wild. In fact, the tagline of his website is &amp;ldquo;Creating drone and deep learning based systems for studying animal groups in the wild.&amp;rdquo; He went up to Alaska with Andrew this summer and filmed a ton of footage of salmon in rivers and streams in 4K and now plans to use the absolutely massive computer in his office to work on computer vision about it.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/annepolyakov/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/annepolyakov/</guid><description>Anne&amp;rsquo;s research covers a variety of animals and ecosystems, including sockeye salmon in Alaskan streams, brush mice in oak woodlands of central California, and mycorrhizal fungi in old-growth forests. She is passionate about interdisciplinary research at the intersection of ecology and statistics!
Some other things about Anne:
Anne is extremely competitive.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/connieokasaki/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/connieokasaki/</guid><description>Connie&amp;rsquo;s general research interests include bridging the gaps between mechanistic modeling, spatial statistics, and constrained optimization. She is particularly&amp;hellip; and then that&amp;rsquo;s where her website cuts off. (Connie if you see this, I think your github.io page is down.)
Connie is a board game player extraordinaire. She has a backpack that can hold upwards of 30 games in organized little pockets or drawers.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/mariakuruvilla/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/mariakuruvilla/</guid><description>Maria works on collective behavior. Specifically, on schooling behavior in fish, and how environmental factors affect a school&amp;rsquo;s ability to respond to stimuli. It&amp;rsquo;s actually so cool - it seems like there&amp;rsquo;s a relationship between how hot or cold the water is and how effective schools of fish are at evading predators, and it has to do with how they behave collectively!</description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/arialbrewer/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/arialbrewer/</guid><description>Arial is broadly interested in the ecology, behavior, communication, and sociality of marine mammals. For her PhD, she is investigating the vocal behavior, intra-population genetic structure, and epidermal microbial patterns of the endangered Cook Inlet beluga whale population. She is also a marine mammal biologist at NOAA and studies the acoustic ecology of cetaceans in the North Pacific.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/brendanwallace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://complexecolab.github.io/people/brendanwallace/</guid><description>Brendan is interested in complex systems, network science, and general scaling laws of movement. His background is in applied math and computer science. Before UW, he worked on modeling traffic for Google maps. He&amp;rsquo;s currently working on introducing risk-structure and movement frequency to an epidemiological model.
Brendan loves board games, ultimate frisbee, talking about why cars are the worst, and talking about why Golang is the best and everyone should learn it.</description></item></channel></rss>

Bibi is a computational ecologist exploring movement ecology from an interdisciplinary perspective, seeking to understand how individual animal movements scale up to reveal population patterns and ecosystem health. Bibi started graduate school in Fall 2025 co-advised by Andrew Berdahl and Julia Parrish.
Before grad school, Bibi studied the effects of climate change on river ecosystems with the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and spatiotemporal changes in global seagrass presence with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center (SERC). Bibi graduated from Colorado College in 2021 with a bachelor's degree in Organismal Biology & Ecology (major) and Human Biology & Kinesiology (minor).
Bibi's adventures have taken him to many places, including filming a documentary in Colorado Springs, protecting native birds in New Zealand, SCUBA diving in Fiji, and coaching youth climbing teams across the United States. I am currently based in Seattle, Washington.

Brendan is interested in complex systems, network science, and general scaling
laws of movement. His background is in applied math and computer science. Before
UW, he worked on modeling traffic for Google maps. He's currently working on
introducing risk-structure and movement frequency to an epidemiological model.

Brendan loves board games, ultimate frisbee, talking about why cars are the
worst, and talking about why Golang is the best and everyone should learn it.
He has a very cute dog that everyone loves and has been to the office exactly
one time (but maybe she'll be back!). He's already been a TA 9 times which has
to be some kind of record.

Brendan frequently says he wishes he went to more SAFS and QERM
things but then he's always too busy coaching ultimate frisbee, so maybe next
week! But actually you guys this is the quarter he's gonna start going to TGIT he
swears.

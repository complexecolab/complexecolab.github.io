Andrew is broadly interested in ecological systems, but currently focus mainly on
problems at the interface of collective behavior and movement ecology. 
He applies a wide range of techniques (theoretical modeling, numerical
simulations, lab experiments and field-work) to explore topics including:

- collective search,
- sensing and navigation,
- the role of collective decision making (both spatial and temporal) in animal migration,
- the implications of group-level behaviors on ecological and evolutionary processes,
- the joint evolution of dispersal and local adaptation

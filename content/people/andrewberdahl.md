Andrew is broadly interested in ecological systems, but currently focus mainly on
problems at the interface of collective behavior and movement ecology. 
He applies a wide range of techniques (theoretical modeling, numerical
simulations, lab experiments and field-work) to explore topics including:

- collective search,
- sensing and navigation,
- the role of collective decision making (both spatial and temporal) in animal migration,
- the implications of group-level behaviors on ecological and evolutionary processes,
- the joint evolution of dispersal and local adaptation


Andrew did his postdoc at the Santa Fe Institute and then wrote some
papers about collective behavior that all his grad students think are the
coolest, so here we are working in his lab.

Catch Andrew drawing functional response types and ecology models he just thought of
on his whiteboard, bringing his three kids out to the river to wade around and look
at fish, or quickly coding up a python module for the class he's teaching
in 15 minutes!

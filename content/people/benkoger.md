Ben works on creating systems that allow for the easy and automated study of
large animal groups in the wild. In fact, the tagline of his website is
"_Creating drone and deep learning based systems for studying animal groups in
the wild._" He went up to Alaska with Andrew this summer and filmed a ton of
footage of salmon in rivers and streams in 4K and now plans to use the
absolutely massive computer in his office to work on computer vision about it.

He did his PhD in Germany, where he one time heard of a friend's bike helmet
getting stolen and now he always brings his bike helmet into the office. 
Ben is known to eat entire boxes of lettuce with no dressing for lunch. He also
eats regular human food sometimes, too. In fact, he's currently working to
implement a way to cook ramen (not just the box kind,
like, actual ramen) in the office on a hot plate. We wish him the
best of luck!

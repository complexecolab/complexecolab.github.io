Anne's research covers a variety of animals and ecosystems, including sockeye salmon in Alaskan streams, brush mice in oak woodlands of central California, and mycorrhizal fungi in old-growth forests. She is passionate about interdisciplinary research at the intersection of ecology and statistics!

Some other things about Anne:

Anne is extremely competitive. Like, kind of scary competitive. One time we had
a QERM ultimate frisbee team and she legitimately made like three people
on the other team cry with just her sheer ferocity and intensity.

Anne loves talking about mushrooms, going on runs and hikes where she can
see mushrooms, and of course cutting mushrooms into tiny little pieces to
analyze their DNA. One time she had to transport a bunch of frozen (I think)
samples on a long road trip and it was really stressful
but she made it OK and so that was a huge success.

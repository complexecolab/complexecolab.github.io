Arial is broadly interested in the ecology, behavior, communication, and sociality 
of marine mammals. For her PhD, she is investigating the vocal behavior, intra-population
genetic structure, and epidermal microbial patterns of the endangered Cook Inlet 
beluga whale population. She is also a marine mammal biologist at NOAA and studies 
the acoustic ecology of cetaceans in the North Pacific. Arial enjoys being in the 
field and has been involved in marine mammal surveys off the coasts of Mexico, 
California, Oregon, Washington, British Columbia, Alaska and Hawaii. Prior to moving
to Seattle from California, Arial worked as a marine mammal trainer and research 
technician studying the bio-acoustics and behavior of bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, 
walrus, sea lions, seals, and sea otters. Arial earned her Bachelor of Science degree 
in Marine Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2010, and is 
excited to be back in academia to help further the conservation effort of endangered 
cetacean species. Arial enjoys sailing, scuba diving, camping, wildlife photography, 
and hiking with her pup.

Arial is investigating the vocal behavior and kinship of the endangered Cook
Inlet beluga whale population. She is a marine mammal biologist at NOAA and
studies the acoustics of cetaceans, primarily belugas and killer whales. Arial
loves spending her time in the field and has been involved in marine mammal
surveys off the coasts of Mexico, California, Oregon, Washington, British
Columbia, Alaska and Hawaii. Prior to moving to Seattle from California,
Arial worked as a marine mammal trainer and research technician studying the
bio-acoustics of bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, walrus, sea lions, seals,
and sea otters in a cooperative setting. Arial earned her Bachelor of Science
degree in Marine Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz in 2010,
and is excited to be back in academia to help further the conservation effort
of endangered cetacean species. Aside from being a whale nerd, Arial enjoys
hiking, scuba diving, camping, wildlife photography, and sailing.

Just to elaborate a tiny bit, 
Arial's deal is that she's literally a marine mammal biologist
at NOAA \*and\* a PhD student in our lab at the same time. She has certain
days of the week she comes in and does PhD stuff, and certain days that she's
off doing NOAA stuff with her NOAA friends. Very cool!

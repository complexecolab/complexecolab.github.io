Isobel is an undergraduate in the Environmental Science and Terrestrial Resource Management (ESRM) program, and may just be one of the most put-together undergraduates you've ever met. Isobel has lived all over the world, plays in two different rock bands, and last quarter set an intention of learning Spanish on Duolingo. I asked Isobel to tell me more about her interests and hobbies and she hasn't get back to me yet, so I looked up her LinkedIn profile and found that she is also a member of the UW Songwriter's Circle, the UW Student Mycology Club, and the UW Beekeeping Club.

Isobel joined our lab after crushing QSCI 292 last spring (2024), and brings previous research experience from working with SEFS. Isobel is broadly interested in research in the life sciences, and will be working with us on a project to understand and quantify timing of salmon seaward migration.

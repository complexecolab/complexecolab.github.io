Isobel is an undergraduate in the Environmental Science and Terrestrial Resource Management (ESRM) program, and may just be one of the most put-together undergraduates you've ever met. Isobel has lived all over the world, plays in two different rock bands, and last quarter set an intention of learning Spanish on Duolingo. Her LinkedIn profile shows that she is also a member of the UW Songwriter's Circle, the UW Student Mycology Club, and the UW Beekeeping Club.

Isobel is broadly interested in research in the life sciences, and will be working with our lab on a project to understand and quantify timing of salmon seaward migration.

Maria works on collective behavior. Specifically, on schooling behavior in
fish, and how environmental factors affect a school's ability to respond
to stimuli. It's actually so cool - it seems like there's a relationship between
how hot or cold the water is and how effective schools of fish are at evading
predators, and it has to do with how they behave collectively! Ask her about it!

Maria has a Master's degree in physics and is arguably the only PhD student at
this point whose research really fits the themes of the lab so we cherish her
for that.

I asked Maria what her hobbies and fun facts were for this bio and told her to
just tell me what she was thinking, that I wouldn't copy and paste it into the
website. Here's what she said:

>Okay hobbies - snorkeling and surfing (but only if water is warmer than 20C), 
> hiking, traveling, cooking (because I like eating)

and:

> fun fact - I have been moving north all my life. I started at latitude 10.
> Now I'm at 47.
> Maybe at climate velocity

Which means Maria might be moving at the exact speed to remain static in
climate space under climate change.

If we had an award for most likely to be down to get lunch on little notice,
Maria would win that award. Maria if you're reading this, want to go to Araya's
Place with me and Ben?

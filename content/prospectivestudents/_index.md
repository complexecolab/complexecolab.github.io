title: Prospective Students
---



Thanks for your interest in our research and the Complex Ecological Systems Lab.
I am excited for you to be exploring a path to graduate school.
Below are some answers to questions I often receive from prospective students.


### How can I apply to your lab?
I can accept students through the [School of Aquatic & Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/students/graduate-program/prepare-apply/) and the  [Quantitative Ecology & Resource Management](https://quantitative.uw.edu/graduate/how-to-apply/) program. I recommend that you explore both and decide which best fits your background and intended goals. Please note that you can apply to both in parallel.

If you plan to apply, please also reach out to me via email with a research statement, CV and unofficial copies of your transcripts. Feel free to do this well ahead of the (usually November/December) deadline. Please use subject line [CESL grad student enquiry], this will help make sure I don't miss your email.


### What sort of students do you accept?
Students in the lab work on a diverse range of systems, though typically have a fairly quantitative background. I am most excited about students whose interests align with the research described across this website and represented in our published work, but am also open to new ideas.


### How does funding work?
I didn’t realize as an undergrad, but you get paid to go to grad school! (Not a ton, but…) Support can come from grants (that I apply for), fellowships (that you apply for), UW scholarships (you will be considered for these automatically when you apply to SAFS or QERM) and TAing classes.

The best thing you can do to increase your chances of getting into the graduate program of your choice is to secure your own funding through a fellowship such as:
1. [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/)
1. [Department of Energy Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (CSGF)](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/)
1. [NOAA Sea Grant Population Dynamics](https://seagrant.noaa.gov/NMFS-SG-Fellowship/)
1. [Ford Foundation Fellowship](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/ford-foundation-fellowships)
1. [Nancy Foster Scholarship](https://fosterscholars.noaa.gov/aboutnf.html)



### Do you currently have funding to take a new student?
Not at this time. I will update this when I do.

### Can we meet?
I am sure I would enjoy meeting with you, but unfortunately my time is limited and I need to conserve my bandwidth to support my current students (and write grants to be able to support you in the future!). Generally, I am not able to meet prospective students prior to you applying.

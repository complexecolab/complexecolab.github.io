# Purveyor of simple models since 2018.

We're an interdisciplinary research lab in the School of Aquatic and Fishery
Sciences (SAFS) and Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM). We
take a complex systems approach to studying a variety of (mostly) ecological
systems, including salmon, marine mammals, fungi, and humans, often focusing on
collective behavior. Our tools and techniques include computer vision,
mathematics, simulation and statistical modeling and network theory.

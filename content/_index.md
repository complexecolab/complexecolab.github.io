# We look for patterns in movement and behavior.

We're an interdisciplinary research lab in the School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences
(SAFS) and Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM).  We study complex ecological
systems such as fisheries, marine mammals, fungi, and collective behavior. Our tools and
techniques include computer vision, simulation modeling, statistical modeling, differential
equation modeling, and network theory.

title: Complex Ecological Systems Lab

# We look for patterns in movement and behavior and use simple models to understand the processes underlying these patterns.


We're an interdisciplinary research lab in the School of Aquatic and Fishery
Sciences (SAFS) and Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management (QERM). We
take a complex systems approach to studying a variety of (mostly) ecological
systems, including salmon, marine mammals, fungi, and humans, often focusing on
collective behavior. Our tools and techniques include computer vision,
mathematics, simulation and statistical modeling and network theory.
